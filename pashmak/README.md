> [!CAUTION]
> Still in Beta. Stable to use but not fully battle tested. I expect a few more things to change. For the most part only new stuff will be added so backward compatibility is mostly guaranteed.

Inspired by laravel and Rails, Pashmak is a typescript focused, ESM first framework. Pashmak was created to provide a simple and seamless way to build web applications, APIs, and services using modern JavaScript and TypeScript features. It is ideal for rapid prototyping and development of web applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices.

Pashmak is designed with developer experience, rapid development and delivery in mind. It aims to provide a clean and intuitive approach so developers can focus on writing business logic rather than dealing with boilerplate code.
