# Introduction

Pashmak is a framework with focus on business logic by abstracting and simplifying as many technical parts as possible. It is an ideal framework where you want to focus on readable code with flexibility to replace underlying dependencies of the system work. This makes Pashmak an ideal framework for new solutions where you want to deliver MVPs quickly and further develop them over time.
