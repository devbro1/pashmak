Inspired by laravel, Pashmak is a typescript focused, ESM only framework. Pashmak was created to provide a simple and elegant way to build web applications, APIs, and services using modern JavaScript and TypeScript features. It is ideal for rapid prototyping and development of web applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices.

Pashmak is designed with developers in mind. It aims to provide a clean and intuitive API so developers can focus on writing business logic rather than dealing with boilerplate code.
