# pashmak

> [!CAUTION]
> Still in Beta. Stable to use but not fully battle tested for production. I expect a few more things to change. For the most part only new stuff will be added so backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

Inspired by laravel and Rails, Pashmak is a typescript focused, ESM only framework. Pashmak was created to provide a simple and seamless way to build web applications, APIs, and services using modern JavaScript and TypeScript features. It is ideal for rapid prototyping and development of web applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices.

Pashmak is designed with developers in mind. It aims to provide a clean and intuitive API so developers can focus on writing business logic rather than dealing with boilerplate code.
